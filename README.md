# 📈 Sales Forecasting Project

## 🔹 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an **end-to-end sales forecasting system** using historical transactional data. The goal is to analyze past sales trends, identify seasonality, and predict future sales to support business decision-making.

The project combines **Python-based time series modeling** with **Power BI dashboards** to deliver both analytical and predictive insights.

---

## 🔹 Problem Statement

Businesses need to anticipate future sales to plan inventory, logistics, and marketing strategies. Using historical sales data, this project forecasts **monthly sales** and visualizes the predictions in an interactive dashboard.

---

## 🔹 Dataset Description

* Source: Sales transaction dataset (2003–2005)
* Key Columns:

  * ORDERDATE – Order date
  * SALES – Revenue generated
  * PRODUCTLINE – Product category
  * COUNTRY – Customer location
  * DEALSIZE – Deal size

---

## 🔹 Tools & Technologies Used

* **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
* **Statsmodels** (ARIMA, SARIMA)
* **Scikit-learn** (Evaluation metrics)
* **Power BI** (Dashboards & forecasting visualization)
* **Google Colab** (Development environment)

---

## 🔹 Project Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Date Processing
2. Monthly Sales Aggregation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (Trend & Seasonality)
4. Time Series Forecasting (ARIMA & SARIMA)
5. Model Evaluation (MAE, RMSE)
6. Future Sales Prediction (12 months)
7. Power BI Dashboard Integration

---

## 🔹 Key Insights

* Classic Cars contribute the highest revenue among product lines
* Medium-sized deals generate the most sales volume
* Sales show seasonal peaks during mid-year periods
* Forecast suggests a stable-to-moderate growth trend

---

## 🔹 Limitations

* Limited historical data (only 3 years)
* External business factors not included
* Accuracy can be improved with additional features

---

## 🔹 Future Improvements

* Use Prophet or LSTM models
* Forecast by Product Line or Country
* Deploy model as a web application

---

## 🔹 Outcome

Successfully built a complete **predictive analytics solution** integrating machine learning forecasting models with business dashboards.
